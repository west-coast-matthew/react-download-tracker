#React Download Tracker

#Background
Supporting the ability to allow a user to download documents through a UI is a farly common operation, which often is not the best experience. 

For example, I have used several products in the past the allow you do download past bills, invoices, or paystubs. In most cases, it becomes slighly annoying that the minimal logic was implemented, and it is not really clear of the download progress.

This project demonstrates what I consider to be an optimal one, allowing the user to monitor download progress in a more effectie manner.
